Project prompt:

I want a production-ready Streamlit project called 'Multi-Tasker' with role-based authentication and a clean Admin Dashboard. It must automatically connect to Render's managed PostgreSQL if available, but prefer a MANUAL_DATABASE_URL when supplied (via .env or env vars). It should create tables on first run, and seed a default admin. The Admin Dashboard should provide per-user page permissions (allow/deny), user management (create/update/deactivate), and a polished UI with Tailwind-like styling, card components, and subtle animations. Copy modal must be implemented as a reusable glassmorphism modal loaded from external assets (modal.css, modal.js) and triggered from Python. Include a secure one-time /setup bootstrap protected by a SETUP_SECRET env var. Include GitHub Actions workflow to run tests and optionally trigger a Render Deploy Hook. The project must be modular and easily extendable: pages are auto-discovered from /pages/*.py. Include README, tests placeholder, and clear deployment instructions for Render.
